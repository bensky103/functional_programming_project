  * **Dataset paths assumed:**
    - Default movies path: `data/movies.csv` (configurable via `movies.path` system property)
    - Default ratings path: `data/ratings.csv` (configurable via `ratings.path` system property)
    - Base data directory: `data/` (configurable via `data.base.dir` system property)

  * **ml-latest-small dataset** - Designated for unit tests and CI/CD operations (smaller dataset for faster test execution)
  * **ml-25m dataset** - Designated for production use (full 25 million rating dataset for production workloads)
  * Both datasets follow MovieLens format with movies.csv (movieId, title, genres) and ratings.csv (userId, movieId, rating, timestamp) structure
  * Dataset selection can be controlled via the configurable path system already implemented in Paths object
